# fast-neural-style :city_sunrise: :rocket:

This repository adds a streamlit app layer on top of the pytorch example implementation of an algorithm for artistic style transfer. The original repository can be found in the examples for pytorch [here:](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main)
The algorithm can be used to mix the content of an image with the style of another image. For example, here is a photograph of a door arch rendered in the style of a stained glass painting.

For instructions on the image transfer process and how to train more images, see the instructions for the original pytorch example.
